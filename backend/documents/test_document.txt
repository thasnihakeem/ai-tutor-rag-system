   Machine Learning
   
   Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms to identify patterns and make predictions.
   
   Types of Machine Learning:
   1. Supervised Learning - Learning from labeled data
   2. Unsupervised Learning - Finding patterns in unlabeled data
   3. Reinforcement Learning - Learning through trial and error
